    <h2>Maintain Favorable Blood Pressure and Cholesterol Levels</h2>
    <p>Many older people are surprised to learn that there are common risk factors between heart disease and Alzheimer’s disease. But if you think about how the vascular system supplies blood to the brain, it makes sense that impairment of blood flow could lead to brain tissue damage.</p>
    
    <p>The small arteries of the brain are sensitive to elevations in blood pressure and long-term hypertension can injure them. Several studies support the connection between blood pressure and brain health. Higher blood pressure correlates with poorer cognitive performance and damage to brain tissue.</p>
    <p>Cholesterol plays a role in the formation of amyloid-beta plaques, damage characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease, and elevated cholesterol levels are thought to increase the production of amyloid-beta plaques.</p>
    
    <h2>Check Your Vitamin D Level</h2>
    
    <p>Low levels of vitamin D are linked to cognitive impairment. Vitamin D is involved in memory formation. Several studies have associated vitamin D deficiency with an increased risk of cognitive impairment or dementia in older adults.</p>
    <p>In addition, the vitamin is involved in regulating glucose and calcium transport to and within the brain, and may also protect cognition by reducing inflammation and increasing the availability of certain neurotransmitters.</p>
    
    <h2>Take the Brain-Supporting Supplements Omega-3 DHA and Vitamin B12</h2>
    
    <p>Maintaining sufficient levels of the omega-3 fatty acid DHA in the brain is an important measure for preventing neurodegenerative diseases later in life. Studies have shown that higher intake and higher circulating omega-3 DHA is associated with larger brain volume and a decreased risk of Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
    <p>B12 deficiency causes problems in the brain, including confusion, depression, and poor memory. A deficiency in this important vitamin has been associated with Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
    <p>Since your body’s ability to absorb vitamin B12 decreases with age, and the vitamin is not present in plant foods, it is wise to supplement. Plus, the RDI is insufficient for flexitarians, vegans and the elderly. </p>
    <h2>Limit Your Consumption of Red Meat and Other Animal Products</h2>
    <p>Copper and iron are essential minerals present in large amounts in red meat; these minerals accumulate in the body over time and in excess, they can harm the brain.</p>
    <p>Instead, they can be obtained in non-dangerous amounts through healthier options such as sesame and pumpkin seeds, edamame, and other beans.</p>
    <h2>Focus on Whole Plant Foods</h2>
    <p>A good rule to follow is to have 90 percent or more of your diet be whole plant foods, meaning vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, and seeds. A diet higher in these foods and low in meat and dairy is associated with a 36 percent decrease in Alzheimer’s risk.</p>
    <p>Make sure your diet is rich in natural, healthy plant foods, and add more raw vegetables to your diet by eating a large salad as your entrée at least once a day. Add beans, tomatoes, raw onions, and a nut or seed-based salad dressing.</p>
